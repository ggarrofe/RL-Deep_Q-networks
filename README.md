# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

This is an introduction to reinforcement learning based on the Imperial College course and the corresponding resources. The code inhere covers the theory and implementation of both Tabular Methods and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

## Tabular methods

Inspired by Sutton and Barton's example in the 4th chapter of its book to learn how to implement tabular methods such as Dynamic programming, and also methods that do not require full knowledge of the dynamic of the environment, namely Monte-Carlo Methods and Temporal-Difference learning. We aim to solve a maze
